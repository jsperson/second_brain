# Weekly Review Skill

Generate a weekly review analyzing captures, project progress, and patterns.

## Trigger

This skill is invoked by:
- Manual command: `/weekly-review`
- Scheduled launchd job: `claude "/weekly-review"` (Sunday 4:00 PM)

## Paths

- **Inbox Log**: `/Users/jsperson/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/scott/Inbox-Log.md`
- **Projects**: `/Users/jsperson/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/scott/Projects/`
- **Tasks**: `/Users/jsperson/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/scott/Tasks/`
- **Output**: `/Users/jsperson/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/scott/Inbox/`

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Inbox Log**
   - Read `Inbox-Log.md`
   - Count captures from the last 7 days
   - Group by category (projects, ideas, people, tasks)
   - Identify any items still in "Needs Review" status

2. **Review Projects**
   - Read all project folders in `Projects/`
   - Identify projects with recent activity
   - Identify stalled projects (no activity in 7+ days)
   - Note blocked or waiting items

3. **Review Tasks**
   - Count completed vs pending tasks
   - Identify overdue items
   - Note patterns in task types

4. **Generate Review**
   - Create file: `Inbox/Weekly-Review-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
   - Use the format below
   - Keep it analytical and actionable (under 250 words body)

5. **Identify Patterns**
   - What themes emerged this week?
   - Where is energy/attention going?
   - What's being neglected?

## Output Format

```markdown
---
type: weekly-review
generated: {ISO timestamp}
week_ending: {YYYYMMDD}

## Guidelines

- **Be analytical, not motivational**
- **Call out projects** that haven't had action in over a week
- **Note if capture volume** was unusually high or low
- **Suggest concrete next actions**, not vague intentions
- **If something looks stuck, say so directly**
- Keep language concise and actionable

## Example Output

```markdown

type: weekly-review
generated: 2026-01-12T16:00:00-06:00
week_ending: 20260112

# Week in Review - Jan 6-12, 2026

## Quick Stats

- **Items captured**: 23
- **Breakdown**: 8 projects, 5 ideas, 3 people, 7 tasks

## What Moved Forward

- Q1 Report submitted on time
- Home renovation contractor selected

## Open Loops (needs attention)

1. **Data Science capstone** - no activity in 10 days, deadline approaching
2. **Tax documents** - waiting on W-2, follow up with employer

## Patterns I Notice

Heavy focus on work projects this week. Personal/life admin tasks are accumulating - 4 of 7 tasks captured were overdue items finally being acknowledged.

## Suggested Focus for Next Week

1. Block 2 hours for capstone project - break the inertia
2. Follow up on W-2 by Tuesday
3. Clear the 3 overdue admin tasks

## Items Needing Review

- "remember the thing" - still unclear, consider deleting
- "interesting article" - no context, needs categorization

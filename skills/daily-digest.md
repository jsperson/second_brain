# Daily Digest Skill

Generate a daily summary of tasks, active projects, and people follow-ups.

## Trigger

This skill is invoked by:
- Manual command: `/daily-digest`
- Scheduled launchd job: `claude "/daily-digest"` (7:00 AM daily)

## Paths

- **Tasks**: `/Users/jsperson/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/scott/Tasks/`
- **Projects**: `/Users/jsperson/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/scott/Projects/`
- **People**: `/Users/jsperson/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/scott/Knowledge/People/`
- **Output**: `/Users/jsperson/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/scott/Inbox/`

## Instructions

1. **Gather Tasks**
   - Read all files in `Tasks/`
   - Look for `due_date` in frontmatter
   - Identify: overdue tasks, tasks due today, tasks due this week

2. **Gather Active Projects**
   - Read project folders in `Projects/`
   - Look for files with `status: active` or recent activity
   - Extract `next_action` if present

3. **Gather People Follow-ups**
   - Read files in `Knowledge/People/`
   - Look for `follow_ups` field in frontmatter or content
   - Identify any pending follow-ups

4. **Generate Digest**
   - Create file: `Inbox/Daily-Digest-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
   - Use the format below
   - Keep it concise (under 150 words in the body)

5. **Prioritize Content**
   - Top 3 most important/urgent actions
   - Overdue items first
   - Items with explicit due dates before open-ended ones

## Output Format

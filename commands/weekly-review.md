Generate a weekly review analyzing captures, project progress, and patterns.

## Configuration

Read `~/source/second_brain/config.yaml` (and `config.local.yaml` if it exists) to get:
- **vault**: `paths.vault` - Obsidian vault root
- **Inbox Log**: `{vault}/Inbox-Log.md`
- **Projects**: `{vault}/Projects/`
- **Tasks**: `{vault}/Tasks/`
- **Output**: `{vault}/Reports/` (reviews go to Reports folder)
- **recipient**: `handles[0]` - iMessage recipient for notifications

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Inbox Log**
   - Read `Inbox-Log.md`
   - Count captures from the last 7 days
   - Group by category (projects, ideas, people, admin)
   - Identify any items still in "Needs Review" status

2. **Review Projects**
   - Read all project folders in `Projects/`
   - Identify projects with recent activity
   - Identify stalled projects (no activity in 7+ days)
   - Note blocked or waiting items

3. **Review Tasks**
   - Count completed vs pending tasks
   - Identify overdue items
   - Note patterns in task types

4. **Generate Review**
   - Create file: `Reports/Weekly-Review-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
   - Use the format below
   - Keep it analytical and actionable (under 250 words body)

5. **Identify Patterns**
   - What themes emerged this week?
   - Where is energy/attention going?
   - What's being neglected?

6. **Send Notification**
   - Send iMessage to recipient with Obsidian link
   - Use this exact format (the [SB] prefix prevents capture loop):
   ```
   [SB] Weekly review ready: obsidian://open?vault=Second%20Brain&file=Reports%2FWeekly-Review-{YYYYMMDD}
   ```
   - Send via osascript:
   ```bash
   osascript -e 'tell application "Messages" to send "[SB] Weekly review ready: obsidian://open?vault=Second%20Brain&file=Reports%2FWeekly-Review-{YYYYMMDD}" to participant "{recipient}" of account id (id of 1st account whose service type = iMessage)'
   ```

## Output Format

```markdown

type: weekly-review

## Guidelines

- **Be analytical, not motivational**
- **Call out projects** that haven't had action in over a week
- **Note if capture volume** was unusually high or low
- **Suggest concrete next actions**, not vague intentions
- **If something looks stuck, say so directly**
